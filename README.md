# MyBBTwitchEmotes
a handy (but shitty) written script to generate myCode for myBB that provides the forum with twitch emotes.

== This is a shit script, it really is.

Get it working by calling it over CLI, it will generate some SQL files you have to import into your DB (split them up for phpMyAdmin users.)
