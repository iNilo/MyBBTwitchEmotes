# MyBBTwitchEmotes
a handy (but shitty) written script to generate myCode for myBB that provides the forum with twitch emotes.

## This is a shit script, it really is.

Get it working by calling it over CLI, it will generate some SQL files you have to import into your DB (split them up for phpMyAdmin users.)


Normal emotes can be acceses with their normal code such as : "Kappa"

Subscriber only emotes need to be surrounded with colons :sum1g:
